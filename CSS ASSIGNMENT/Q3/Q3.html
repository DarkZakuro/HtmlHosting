    <p> A font is a set of printable or displayable text characters in a specific style and size. 
        The type design for a set of fonts is the typeface and variations of this design form the typeface family . 
        Thus, Helvetica is a typeface family, Helvetica italic is a typeface, and Helvetica italic 10-point is a font. 
        In practice, font and typeface are often used without much precision, sometimes interchangably.<ul>
